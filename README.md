**Project Title:** Predicting Rental Bike Demand for Optimized Availability

**Description:**

This project tackles the crucial task of predicting the hourly demand for rental bikes in an urban environment. The goal is to equip city planners and bike-sharing service providers with a reliable forecasting model that minimizes waiting times and ensures a stable supply of bikes, ultimately enhancing public mobility.

**Data:**

The project utilizes a dataset encompassing weather information (temperature, humidity, windspeed, visibility, etc.), bike rental counts per hour, and date-related features (hour, day, season, holiday status, etc.).

**Techniques:**

- **Machine Learning Models:** Employ a range of linear and non-linear regression models, including linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and XGBoost.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Leverage GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of each model for optimal performance.
- **Outlier Handling:** Implement a custom function to efficiently identify and handle outliers based on Interquartile Range (IQR) and median values, ensuring data integrity.
- **Multicollinearity Analysis:** Investigate potential multicollinearity among features using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis. Strategically address identified multicollinearity through dimensionality reduction techniques or feature selection approaches to enhance model accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluate model performance using a combination of metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Thoroughly clean and prepare the data, addressing missing values, categorical encoding, and outlier handling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct in-depth EDA using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations to understand data distribution, relationships among features, and potential patterns influencing bike demand.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create potentially useful derived features (e.g., temperature interactions, holiday type dummies) to enhance model performance, while being mindful of multicollinearity.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Split the data into training and testing sets. Train various regression models, optimize hyperparameters, and rigorously evaluate their performance using the selected metrics.
5. **Model Selection:** Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results, aiming for a balance between accuracy and complexity. Consider further insights from dimensionality reduction techniques to potentially improve predictions.

**Results:**

- **Impact of Seasonality:** Winter appears to have a significant influence on bike demand (note the importance of additional data across all seasons for verification).
- **Key Predictive Features:** Summer, dewpoint temperature, temperature, and hour exhibit strong relationships with bike counts, suggesting seasonality and weather conditions are key factors in demand.
- **Model Performance:** Report the metrics (MSE, R-squared, MAE) achieved by the chosen model, providing a clear picture of its predictive power.
- **Visualization:** Employ visually appealing charts and graphs to effectively showcase important findings, such as feature correlations and predicted vs. actual bike counts.

**Future Work:**

- **Data Expansion:** Collect data from additional years and seasons to strengthen the model's generalizability.
- **Real-Time Forecasting:** Explore integration with real-time weather data feeds to provide on-the-fly predictions.
- **Deep Learning Exploration:** Investigate the potential benefits of applying deep learning architectures like LSTMs or convolutional neural networks for more complex demand patterns (consider computational resources).

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging machine learning to predict bike demand in urban settings. Addressing seasonality, weather conditions, and potential multicollinearity are crucial considerations for accurate and robust forecasting. The insights gained pave the way for optimizing bike availability, minimizing waiting times, and enhancing public mobility in urban environments.

By incorporating these elements, you'll create a comprehensive and informative README file that effectively represents the project's value to potential employers.
